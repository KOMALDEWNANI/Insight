### Functionality & Concepts used :
- The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the users read, save, delete, search articles. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
- Android Jetpack Navigation Component : To switch between different fragments namely, breaking news, saved news, search news and article. Using Navigation Component increases app's interface as well as app's user experience.
- LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update the news feed and saved articles and also update it to local databases using Room. 
- Glide Library - To display images in the app as fetched by the NEWS API.
- RecyclerView - To display news in a scrollable List.
- Retrofit - To make it easier to consume RESTful web services.

### Application Link & Future Scope :
- You can access the app by clicking here: https://github.com/KOMALDEWNANI/Insight/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- We plan to categorize the news into different sections like educational, current affairs, technology etc.
